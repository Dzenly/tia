/**
 * The TEQ (Tia ExtJs Query) search string.
 * The TEQ is a mix of following two abilities:
 * https://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.5.3/classic/Ext.ComponentQuery.html#method-query
 * https://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.5.3/classic/Ext.Component.html#cfg-reference
 *
 * Note: There is a difference in default flag for xtype search.
 * Do not use the xtype(true) syntax in TEQ, because (true)
 * is added by default. I.e. ExtJs query has (false) by default, but TEQ has (true) by default.
 * And you have not ability to pass (false) in TEQ. So you always search by exact xtype and not
 * by the inheritance chain.
 *
 * Locale: Front end locale, which is set by gT.e.utils.setLocaleObject().
 * In the component queries, substrings like 'l"locale_key"' will be replaced by '"value_for_key"',
 * i.e. '[text=l"settings"]' will be changed to '[text="Настройки"] for russian locale.
 *
 * Extra locale: Back end locale, which is set by gT.e.utils.setExtraLocaleObject()
 * In the component queries, substrings like 'el"locale_key"' will be replaced by '"value_for_key"',
 * i.e. '[text=el"settings"]' will be changed to '[text="Настройки"] for russian extra locale.
 *
 * Also fake ids id like '##idKey' will be replaced by '#realId' from tiaEJ.idMap.
 *
 * References can be specified using '&' prefix. Say if your TEQ string is:
 * '#someId &someReference someXType', then the function will search the component with id 'someId',
 * then it will be equal to:
 * Ext.ComponentQuery('#someId).lookupReference('someReference').query(someXType)

 * You can use 'false' for these inner calls, and print some your string like 'login ... OK'.
 * See also gT.e.q.wrap and gIn.wrap functions.
 *
 * If this parameter is omitted - default 'enableLog' will be used.
 * Note: Default enableLog is 'true' (gT.engineConsts.defLLLogAction).
 *
 * Some API functions can use its own default enableLog, it this case such function description contains
 * an explanation.
 *
 * Note: the '--force-log-actions' cmd line option works as if all enableLog are true,
