### Notes about ExtJs

* To save your time for autotests creation and to make tests faster, it is strongly recommended to develop some design of id naming in your project, and use id everywhere. In complex cases you should use itemId. You should not rely on XPath, attributes, css styles, etc.

* Also you can use s.browser.executeScript to access ExtJs objects your way and return JS DOM for further interactions by TIA API and selenium-webdriver API.
